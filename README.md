# Caesar Cipher Text Encryption/Decryption Tool

This Python-based program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can specify a shift value for the encryption or decryption process, providing a simple yet effective way to secure textual information.

## Features
- Encrypt text by shifting characters based on a user-defined value.
- Decrypt text using the same shift value.
- Easy-to-use interface for quick encryption and decryption.
- Supports uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.

## How It Works
1. **Encryption**: Each character in the text is shifted forward by the user-defined shift value.
2. **Decryption**: The process reverses the shift, restoring the original text.
3. Input a shift value of your choice and see the magic of the Caesar Cipher in action.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd caesar-cipher-tool
   ```
3. Run the program:
