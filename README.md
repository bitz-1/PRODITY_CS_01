Caesar Cipher Text Encryption/Decryption Tool
Description
This project is a Python-based tool that implements the Caesar Cipher Algorithm for text encryption and decryption. Users can specify a shift value to encode or decode their text securely. It provides a simple and intuitive way to learn about classical encryption techniques and explore their functionality.

Features
Encryption: Encrypts text by shifting characters by a user-specified value.
Decryption: Decrypts text by reversing the encryption shift.
Custom Shift Values: Users can define the shift value for the encryption and decryption process.
Case Sensitivity: Preserves the case (uppercase or lowercase) of the input text.
Error Handling: Ensures invalid inputs are handled gracefully.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the script using Python (python caesar_cipher.py).
Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt text.
Enter the text and the desired shift value.
View the encrypted or decrypted output.
Example
plaintext
Copy code
Enter your choice (1: Encrypt, 2: Decrypt): 1
Enter the text to encrypt: HelloWorld
Enter the shift value: 3

Encrypted text: KhoorZruog
Applications
Educational tool for understanding classical cryptography.
Simple demonstration of encryption and decryption techniques.
Fun tool for encoding secret messages.
Requirements
Python 3.x
